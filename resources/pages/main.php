  <img title="Broken File" class="broken" src="../resources/images/broken.gif" width="20" height="22"> Hello!

  I am Gavin "ioi_xd" Parker, a 20 year old programmer<noprint> (see the windows beside this for more info on that)
  </noprint>, artist, and aspiring filmmaker.
</p>

<p>I specialize in writing applications in Rust, Go, and Python. I also can write an HTML/CSS/JS frontend and have written backends in Javascript and PHP. I decided not to make programming my job because I would prefer to do it as a hobby, realizing that the industry values getting products out as fast as possible over good programming, and have instead decided to persue IT.</p>

<p>As a freelance programmer, I have:
<ul>
	<li>Created my own game engine, intended to be used with friends. It's meant to be used via Lua and a considerably large amount of code is in place to bind a Rust physics library to it. (<a href="https://github.com/IoIxD/engine_xd/">https://github.com/IoIxD/engine_xd/</a>)</li>
	<li>Created a Minecraft plugin that allows me to make other plugins without Java and make them with Rust instead. It was accomplished via a Python script that takes data generated by a Java program to create 4,492,129 lines of code. (<a href="https://github.com/orgs/BlackBoxMC/repositories">https://github.com/orgs/BlackBoxMC/repositories</a>)</li>
	<li>Created a website via the Golang programming language that makes forums within the chat software “Discord” appear on a real website, allowing them to be found on Google (<a href="https://github.com/IoIxD/dforum">https://github.com/IoIxD/dforum</a>)</li>
	<li>Created another custom forum software, also via Golang, for a website between me and friends (<a href="https://github.com/AwesomewareInc/LaffForum">https://github.com/AwesomewareInc/LaffForum</a>)</li>
	<li>Created two programs, one in Golang and the other in Rust, that generate psychedlic imagery by combining two gradient/noise images in a special way (https://github.com/IoIxD/glitchfk).</li>
	<li>Created a Golang (and later Rust) program that turns PNGs into SVGs on a pixel by pixel basis, allowing me to display retro pixel art on websites without scaling issues (<a href="https://github.com/IoIxD/png_to_svg">https://github.com/IoIxD/png_to_svg</a>)</li>
	<li>Created a website via HTML/CSS/JavaScript that allows you to recolor the VLC logo (a traffic cone) to represent a LGBTQIA+ pride flag (<a href="https://github.com/IoIxD/VLCConeChanger">https://github.com/IoIxD/VLCConeChanger</a>)</li>
    	<li style='margin-left: 1em'>Created a website via Golang that displays archives from several D&D servers that me and friends have been in (<a href="https://github.com/AwesomewareInc/DungeonArchive). Also created a script via Python that backs up said servers (https://github.com/AwesomewareInc/PyDiscordArchiver">https://github.com/AwesomewareInc/DungeonArchive). Also created a script via Python that backs up said servers (https://github.com/AwesomewareInc/PyDiscordArchiver</a>)</li>
	<li style='margin-left: 1em'>Created various Minecraft plugins within Java, including:</li>
    	<li style='margin-left: 1em'>One that allows you to view a Mastodon server in game (<a href="https://github.com/AwesomewareInc/Mastodwarf">https://github.com/AwesomewareInc/Mastodwarf</a>)</li>
    	<li style='margin-left: 1em'>One that adds Pokemon cards into the game (<a href="https://github.com/AwesomewareInc/PokemonCardPlugin">https://github.com/AwesomewareInc/PokemonCardPlugin</a>)</li>
    	<li style='margin-left: 1em'>One that allows you to throw the TNT and Anvil blocks at players (<a href="https://github.com/AwesomewareInc/Hookshot">https://github.com/AwesomewareInc/Hookshot</a>)</li>
</ul>
