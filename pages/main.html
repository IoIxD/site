<br>
I am Gavin &ldquo;ioi_xd&rdquo; Parker, a 19 year old programmer, artist, and aspiring filmmaker. <br>
I have several years of experience in HTML/CSS, and around a year or so of experience with advanced Javascript (and as such, Node.js) and I&rsquo;m currently learning Golang for my desktop and server applications. I&rsquo;m alright, albiet rusty, with PHP and Python.<br>
In general, I really like technology, especially that of the older variety (1980-2002) but i consider myself a general fan. I&rsquo;m probably going to go into programming full time, but I&rsquo;d also like to make at least one film or comic in my life, as I also like doing 3d modelling and sometimes 2d art.<br>
<br>
In addition to this being my resume kind of, this is generally where I put all my dumb shit. In addition to serving as my carrd/listography (the actual sites don&rsquo;t give the customization i&rsquo;m looking for) this is where i put my art and sometimes programs.<br>
<br>
Feel free to look around here, or check out <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/IoIxD/site">my github</a> to see what my main projects are and gauge the quality of my code. If you like any of the other things I like/do, we should be friends!<br>
