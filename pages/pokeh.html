<p>It's been 7 years since your brother Mario died, risking his life trying to prevent the outcome of the great H war. A foreign species consisting only of the Letter H had invaded the land, infecting the Pokemon genetically and causing them to morph into their own kind. It wasn't easy without Pokemon behind their side; it simply was not possible either. The H army won the war. As a result, nobody in the continent - no, the universe - is allowed to speak any other vowel other then H; otherwise the H god will hear them and smite them. You have to escape, Luigi, and there's only one way how: by competing in the Pokemon league challenge and winning a ticket to the SS Anne, where abolitionists will rig the ship and transport you to another dimension. It's life or death, Luigi. It's up to you to regain your sanity.</p>
