		<p>the benchmark that wastes your time.</p>
		<p>you will never render this scene in a timely manner. <strikethrough><b>I</b> will never render this scene in a timely manner.</strikethrough> it loads 8192x8192 PNG quality textures onto a scene with a 16384x8192 skybox, with a ground that takes up 52,448,800 triangles, 26,224,400 faces, and 26,356,900 faces.</p>
		<p><em><a href='./br.png' target='_blank'>this is all really funny because the scene looks like shit. like legitimately this looks awful it's an eyesore you would not believe this takes as long as it does.</a></em></p>
		<p>if you should actually fucking attempt this then i would hope you have a 255GB swapfile ready so that this can chew through the RAM you don't have. if you get a faster time then me i'll post it<br>
		unless otherwise stated, for all results the scene was rendered at 2048x1536, with 4096 samples.
