                          Getting RetroZilla

==========================================================================

You can download the source code of RetroZilla from the RetroZilla GitHub
at

  https://github.com/rn10950/RetroZilla

Keep in mind that the source code in its raw form may be buggy. If you are
looking for a more polished version of RetroZilla, the RetroZilla project 
releases builds of RetroZilla regularly that you can download from

  https://rn10950.github.io/RetroZillaWeb/
 
Be sure to read the RetroZilla release notes for information on known
problems and installation issues with RetroZilla.  The release notes 
can be found at the preceding URL along with the releases themselves.

                         System Requirements

==========================================================================

* General

   If you want to view and use the "Modern" theme, your display monitor
   should be set to display thousands of colors. For users who cannot set
   their displays to use more than 256 colors, the RetroZilla project
   recommends using the "Classic" theme for RetroZilla.

   To select the Modern theme after you have installed RetroZilla, from 
   the browser, open the View menu, then open the Apply Theme submenu and
   choose Modern.

*Windows

   - Windows 95, 98, Me, NT4, 2000 or XP
   - Intel Pentium class processor (233 MHz or faster recommended)
   - 64 MB RAM
   - 26 MB free hard disk space

* We recommend that Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8.x and 10 users not use 
  RetroZilla, and instead use the current version of SeaMonkey or Firefox. 
  They are much more secure and compatible with the modern web than 
  RetroZilla is.

* We recommend that Windows 2000 users use Firefox 12 or SeaMonkey 2.9.

* We recommend that Windows 98 and Me users use Firefox 3.6 or SeaMonkey 
  2.0.14 with the KernelEx platform.

                      Installation Instructions

==========================================================================

It is strongly recommended that you exit all programs before running the
setup program. Also, you should temporarily disable virus-detection
software.

Install into a clean (new) directory. Installing on top of previously
released builds may cause problems.

Note: These instructions do not tell you how to build RetroZilla.
